# [working title] Detecting cardiovascular diseases with smartphones and AI

## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting
for 1.71 million deaths in 2021 in Europe alone[^1].
Early detection of heart disease can improve patient outcome and
reduce the burden on the health care system[^3].
At the same time, advances in sensing technology, information processing and artificial
intelligence offer new ways to identify patients at risk and diagnose diseases.
This work will explore ways to incorporate artificial intelligence into various steps
along the clinical pathway.

First, we leverage sensors available in consumer smartphones
to capture different cardiac signals. We can then apply signal processing and machine
learning to identify heart diseases.
Second, we implement and extend state-of-the-art solutions in artificial intelligence
for processing multi-modal clinical data.

## State of the art
- Haddad MCG from Smartphone
- Heart sound from smartphone

- Self-supervised pre-training with unlabelled data (contrastive learning, pretext tasks)
- SotA architectures

## Methods
First, we use sensors available in consumer smartphones to acquire cardiac signals and
apply signal processing and machine learning to detect
